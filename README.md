# Azure Shell Code Walk challenge

## TL;DR
> Encourage the CloudSkills community to learn Azure by coding for Azure Cloud Shell, using Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI, bash or PowerShell, and to share that learning effectively back to the community. Enable learners with a best practices documented guidance, including a code template for Azure Cloud Shell code-walks, for the purpose of increasing and sharing our knowledge of Azure. 


## Overview
> Writing code to work with cloud functionality is an ideal way to learn it.
> Writing code to share our learning is a great way to deepen our knowledge while contributing to the community.
> Reading clearly written code with informative comments is also a great way to learn.
> CloudSkills community can build a resource to learn and teach others in the larger cloud community.

## Goals for aspiring cloud builders
- Learn to use Azure via command line
- Explain as you learn
  - Deepen understanding
  - Practice teaching
- Practice content development
- Toe in the water step toward becoming a CS Contributor
- Practice using Git, GitHub, pull requests to contribute

## Steps to get started (Detailed guidance coming soon)
- Fork the code-walks repo
- Choose any Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell command you're intrigued by and step through it!
- Use the [**az-code-walk-template.azcli**](/azcli/az-codewalk-template.azcli) as a starting point or refer to existing code-walk files for inspiration.
- Once you've completed your code-walk, it works, and it's explained clearly in comments, you are ready to..
- SUBMIT A PULL REQUEST (PR) with your change!
